          </h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to our wedding website! We're so excited to have you with us
            to celebrate our marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps unsurprisingly, we're opting for something a little
            unconventional.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'll be getting married on the <strong>17th June</strong> (time
            TBD) and afterwards we'll be having a
            <strong>small celebration at our home</strong>. Then in the late
            afternoon we'll be burning rubber to the
            <strong>Forest of Dean</strong> for a weekend away. We're not having
            a stag or hen do, so we hope that you can
            <strong>join us</strong> in the Forest of Dean. Of course, if you're
            not able to join us for the weekend and you just want to come to the
            ceremony and to check out our awesome garden, we'd love that too.
          </p>

              We'd love you to join us for a weekend of canoeing, hiking, BBQs
              and hot tubs! If that sounds up your street you'll need to book
              your own cabin. Kids and dogs are welcome at the campsite (Plum is
              coming!) and cabins sleep anywhere from 2-10 people.
            </p>

            <p>
              For anyone joining for the weekend, we'd suggest stocking up on
              food to cover the weekend in your cabin but we'll bring pizzas for
              dinner on the Friday üçï
            </p>

            <p>Cabins need to be booked for the 17th to 20th June.</p>

            <p>
              We're in cabin number 84, so try and get one near by if you can.
